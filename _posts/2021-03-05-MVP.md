title: Minimum Viable Product

There's something nice about having a part of the internet to call my home, and it's something that I've wanted for a while. I've started (and not finished) multiple websites and blogs in the past but one thing has always held me back: the idea that they had to be perfect. I got so caught up in making the perfect theme or worrying if I have anything of value to provide that I never actually put anything out there. 

That's where the idea of the minimum viable product comes in: a version of the product that is put out quickly and has just enough features to be usable. It can be improved and built upon over time through feedback and iteration.

A minimum viable product for a blog is just something to read. It doesn't have to be beautiful or have tons of features. It needs to be readable but doesn't have to have perfect prose. Everything can be improved over time; the most important thing is that something exists to improve.
